### Browser support

This library will always have the previous year as its target. For 2021 for example the target will be ES2020.
It always provides both a `UMD` (`.js`) and `.mjs` version. If you want to support legacy browsers, please use the feature of your bundler to transpile dependencie. In case of
webpack and babel (give [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) a try, it's awesome) you'll have to install corresponding plugins such
as [babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining) and include the dependency from `node_modules` which is normally
entirely excluded from being processed.

I do this to provide maximum flexibility and give those who target ESNext a chance to make full use of how this library is bundled.
Everything else is just a matter of configuration :)

### Is this library the right choice for me?

Viselect primarily focuses on being a high-performant engine to select elements with various boundaries, behaviours and modes in your browser.
Viselect is to "full-blown libraries" what is [popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) to [tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/) - the _core_ of your feature / of another
library.

### Development

Use the following commands to work on this locally (we use [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage this):

* `npm run dev` _- Spawns a dev-server for all packages. Every framework-dependend package is bundled with the vanilla version._
* `npm run build` _- Builds all packages in parallel._
* `npm run lint:fix` _- Lints and fixes all errors in all packages._

For the development servers [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is used. It's superb, you should give it a try.
To bundle it we use [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) (which is btw also used by vite behind the scenes) to have full control over how the bundle looks like.

### Releasing a new version

This project is managed via [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/).
To bump the version and publish a new one run the following commands:

* `lerna version`
* `lerna publish from-package`
